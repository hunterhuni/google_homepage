Hello there!

This is my attempt to clone the Google homepage's design. It's written in pure html and css. Interactivity wasn't a goal.

Live demo: https://hunterhuni.github.io/google_homepage

Currently it's not responsive. I might update it at some point in the future.

It's one of the first challenges in The Odin Project's curriculum.
